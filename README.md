Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

(1) Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Ans: Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing,testing and maintaining software and its importance in the technology industry are quality assurance,scalability,effiency,maintanability,innovation,business impact and security.

(2) Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Ans: The birth of software engineering,this milestone marked the beginning of the discipline and it led to the formalization of software engineering practices and etc.

Ans:The introduction of the waterfal model,it brought structure to the software development process and was widely adopted.

Ans:The agile revolution,it emphazises flexibility,iterative development and close collaboration between developers and clients.

(3)List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Ans: Requirement gathering and analysis,this phase involves collecting and documenting the business and technical requirements for the software.

Ans: System design,this phase consists of to levels being the high level design which focuses on the overall system architecture and the low level design which focuses on detailed design of each module or component.

Ans:Implemetion (coding),in this phase developers write the actualcode based on the design specification.They use progamming languages,frameworks and tools to build the software.


(4)Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Ans: Waterfall and agile are two distinct software development methodologies that differ in their approach to managing the development process.Both have their strenghts and weaknesses.
waterfall can be used for when building a goverment system;A goverment project with specific,well defined requirements such as an internal system for processing tax data.Agile is best suited for projects ith evolving requirements for example developing a mobile ap for social networking.

(5)Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Ans: Software developer is responsible for designing,writting,testing and maintaining the coe that powers the software application
    Quality assurance engineer is responsible for ensuring the software product meets the required quality standards by identifying bugs and veryfying that the software works.
    Project manager is responsible for overseeing the planning,execution and completion of a software product.

(6)Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Ans:The importance of IDEs  are effiency and productivity,error detection and debugging, code completion and suggestions and examples of IDEs are visual studio,Pycharm and intelliJ IDEA.
    The importance of VCS is collaboration,backup and recovery,branching and merging and examples of VCS are Git,Subversion and Mercurial.

(7)What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 
 Ans:Software engineers can face challenges such as complex requirements and scope creep to overcome this challenge there has be clear communication,Agile methodology,version control 
     and documentation.
     Time management and deadlines and to overcome this is by breaking down large tasks,timeboxing and task priorization.

(8)Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Ans: Unit testing is the process of testing individual units or components of a software application in isolation and its importance is early bug detection,improves code quality and faster debugging.

Intergration testing focuses on testing the interaction between different modules or components of an application and itd importance is that is verifies interactions,detects interface issues an reduces regression risks.

System testing involves testing the entire system as awhole to ensure it meets the specified requirements and its importance is the end to end testing,requirement validation and confirms system performance.

Acceptance testing is the process of evaluating whether the sotware meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment and its importance is that it confirms business requirements,stakeholder confidence and user readiness.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


(1)Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 Ans: Prompt engineering refers to the practise of designing and refining inputs like GPT.The goal of prompt engineering is to craft inputs that elicit the most accurate,relevant,and useful responses from the AI system and its importance is that it maximizes model effectiveness,reduces ambiguity and improves consistency.

(2)Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Ans: Vague prompt "Tell me about climate change"
improved prompt would be "Explain the causes of climate change and its impact on global weather patterns,including both natural and human induced factors"
This prompt is effective because it is specific,it clarifies and concise.
